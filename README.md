# Todo-list
Todo list - It lists everything that you have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down all in one place so you don't forget anything important. 

We can do npm start to run our website and open our website on local host 5000 port i.e localhost:5000 .
